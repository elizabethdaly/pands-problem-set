## Problem 1
**File:** problem1.py

Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between one and that number.

Python tutorial 3.1.1 for the different types of numbers
https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#numbers

I used stackoverflow to investigate how to reject incorrect keyboard input:
https://stackoverflow.com/a/5424739

I decided to accept all numbers initially. Then negative numbers and 0 are rejected, and the decimal part of floats is discarded.

## Problem 2
**File:** problem2.py

Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a day that begins with the letter T.

Python tutorial for:
* datetime module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#module-datetime
* calendar module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/calendar.html#module-calendar

I used stackoverflow to check how to extract the day name from the 
day of week integer that datetime returns:

## Problem 3
**File:** problem3.py

Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not by 12.
